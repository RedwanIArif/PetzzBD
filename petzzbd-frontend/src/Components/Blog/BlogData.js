        title: "Recognizing Your Cat's Normal vs. Not Normal",
        description:
            "Who knows your cat better than you? Nobody! However, cats hide almost everything (especially pain), so you might not realize that they’re hurting. Their cryptic behavior is a hold-over from their past, when they lived in the wild instead of our living rooms. Back then, cats who showed signs of illness and pain stood out to predators, and masking their discomfort was a key survival strategy. In the safety of our living rooms, cats are more comfortable and therefore may be likely to show signs of their pain.",
        block1: "When cats are in unfamiliar places (like a veterinarian’s exam room), it’s doubtful they’ll show signs of joint pain. That’s why your veterinarian relies on you to report changes in your cat’s behavior for more accurate diagnoses. Exactly how well you know your cat — their personality, daily habits, and silly quirks — is critical when it comes to their health. This way you can more easily tell when something isn’t right. ",
        block2: "Getting to know and documenting your cat’s normal behaviors establishes a baseline, much like what your veterinarian does during annual wellness visits. They want a reference point for bloodwork, urine, weight, and other health factors to know what’s normal for your cat. Detecting a change is much easier with a baseline — even small variations in your cat’s “normal” can indicate a potentially big problem.",
        block3: "If you’ve known your cat since they were a kitten, establishing a baseline of what’s normal can start as early as you’d like (but start when cat is at least a year old and now an adult). Taking short videos of your cat doing normal activities is a great way to track their behaviors over time.",

            "We know how critical sight is to our everyday lives — but what about your cat? Do you need to worry about their vision? The short answer is yes! Cats can focus on small objects in the distance, making them great hunters and players. Preserving their vision helps them function in their environment comfortably and lets them do what comes naturally. ",
        block1: "Cats can develop many of the same eye issues that people do, such as conjunctivitis (pink eye), cataracts, corneal ulcers, glaucoma, and more. Knowing how to recognize common eye issues and their symptoms will help you know when veterinary care is needed to help protect your cat’s vision and maintain their overall health. ",

        block2: "Conjunctivitis occurs when the thin mucous membrane of the eye (conjunctiva) is inflamed. It’s more often caused by viral infections (feline herpesvirus type 1 or calicivirus) than bacterial infections. It can also be caused by environmental allergens or irritants such as dust, airborne chemicals, and plants.",
        block3: "The symptoms of conjunctivitis in cats can be present in one or both eyes. Often, the third eyelid (the membrane located in the inner corner of your cat’s eye) is also affected. It can become red and swollen. Common symptoms of cat conjunctivitis include redness, swelling, discharge, pain, squinting, frequent blinking, and rubbing at the eye(s). Your cat scratching or rubbing their eyes due to the pain and discomfort can cause additional self-inflicted trauma. This can result in hemorrhage, systemic inflammation, and inflammation of the blood vessels.",

        description:
            "Cat facial expressions may be subtle and hard to spot by the untrained eye. But armed with a little information, you can use your cat’s ears, eyes, muzzle, whiskers, and head position to better understand when your cat might be experiencing pain (and to what degree).",
        block1: "Because cats are masters at hiding their pain, we need to look beyond obvious indicators when trying to figure out what and how they're feeling. We don't want our feline companions to suffer. And considering the arsenal of pain management tools available, they don't have to. ",
        block2: "There are many indicators of how your cat is feeling if you know what to look for. Pain may be reflected in some physical changes, like difficulty jumping up onto or down from higher surfaces, decreased appetite, and trouble chasing moving objects. There may also be behavioral changes, like a decrease in activity level, less interaction with family members, and becoming more irritable or withdrawn. But cat facial expressions can also be valuable clues in assessing your cat’s pain level in acute states when they are experiencing medical, surgical or oral pain. In fact, veterinary professionals are learning how to add this assessment into their diagnosis and treatment protocols.",

        block3: "In 2019, a study was conducted by researchers at the University of Montreal to develop a Feline Grimace Scale[1]. Cats with naturally-occurring pain were closely observed, and by evaluating the cat’s ear position, amount the eyes were closed, muzzle tension, whisker direction or change, and head position — all defined as “action units” — a total score can be calculated. This tool, along with other indicators of pain, can be used to quickly and easily assess the level of pain your cat may be experiencing. ",

        description:
            "It’s not uncommon for cats to “go a couple of rounds”, even if they’re usually best buds. But fighting cats can turn into biting cats, and those bites can easily get infected with bacteria and turn into skin infections and abscesses. Here’s what you need to know about cat bite abscesses and how to treat them.",
        block1: "When one cat sinks their tiny razor-sharp teeth into another cat, they make a puncture wound that leaves bacteria from the mouth deep into the skin and muscles. The skin rapidly heals over, leaving the bacteria to multiply and infect the deeper tissues. The not-so-pretty result is often an abscess, which is an infected wound that can swell up, ooze pus and even burst. Abscesses are very painful for cats and can even cause a fever.",
        block2: "If the cat is fighting with a cat that is infected with certain diseases, such as feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukemia virus, rabies, or Bartonella, they are also at risk for getting those diseases.It’s not easy to find a bite wound or abscess under all that fur, and the early warning signs are subtle",
        block3: "If you think your cat has a bite or an abscess, call your veterinarian’s office right away. The bite area needs to be examined and cleaned, and your cat might need antibiotics, pain medication, and/or possibly even surgery. Earlier veterinary treatment typically results in the best outcome for your cat.",

            "Cats love the bird’s eye view – jumping up to the window sill for birdwatching or finding that perfect sunny spot. When those favorite spots seem out of reach for your cat, they may be showing you signs of pain due to osteoarthritis.",
        block1: "Chronic pain, like that from osteoarthritis (OA), is surprisingly common in cats. Clinical studies have found signs of osteoarthritis in 61% of cats over the age of six[1] and in 90% of cats over the age of 12[2]. 40% of those cats showed signs of pain[3]. Chronic osteoarthritis pain can become a serious health problem for your cat — without treatment, the pain will continue to get worse. Helping your cat begins by talking with your veterinarian and coming up with a medical treatment plan to relieve your cat’s pain.",
        block2: "Cats hide signs of pain as much as possible (it’s a survival strategy left over from when they lived in the wild). But there’s good news — because you know your cat’s playful ways and what they love better than anyone, you’re the best person to spot when changes in these behaviors could be signs of osteoarthritis pain.",
        block3: "Cats hide almost everything, especially pain. They’re masters at disguising their discomfort as part of their survival instinct; this is especially true in the veterinary exam room. Your veterinarian relies on you to report changes in your cat’s behavior seen at home for more accurate diagnoses. It’s a great idea to take videos of your cat doing these activities so you can show your vet next time you see them. ",

        description:
            "Whether they’re indoor-only, outdoor, or a combo of both, cats are at risk of catching some nasty diseases. Vaccines can help by stimulating your cat’s immune system to produce antibodies against preventable diseases, so they don’t needlessly suffer or pass those diseases on to other cats.",
        block1: "Feline viral rhinotracheitis. This is a herpesvirus that causes upper respiratory infections or pulmonary infections in cats. This goes far beyond a cat cold, since once a cat is infected, they are infected for life. The disease can be dormant in the cat’s system — but due to stress or other illnesses, it may be reactivated, at which time signs of disease will be more noticeable. It’s highly contagious and can cause death due to pneumonia in kittens and immunocompromised adult cats. Mild cases can be treated at home, but severe cases can last for weeks, require hospitalization, lead to loss of vision, or become a chronic disease with stress.",

        block2: "Feline calicivirus. This is a highly contagious virus that causes upper respiratory infections in cats as well as oral disease (inflammation and ulcers on the tongue and gums). Some strains can cause painful lameness in the cat’s legs as well. Cats can become re-infected with this virus, so prevention is the key to keeping cats well.",
        block3: "Feline panleukopenia. Also called feline parvo or feline distemper, this is a highly contagious virus caused by the feline parvovirus that invades and can kill rapidly by dividing cells in a cat’s bone marrow and intestines. The disease, which used to be the leading killer of cats, is now uncommon due to the highly effective vaccine. This is an important reason to continue vaccinating against it throughout your cat’s life.",

            "Many owners question whether their dog needs all the recommended or required vaccines. After all, you keep your dog close, you don’t go hiking together in the deep woods, and your pup spends all their time inside your home and yard. Is your dog really still at risk for diseases they can be vaccinated against? The answer is yes.",
        block1: "Dogs are social. It’s not just about your dog coming into direct contact with others. You also must consider shared animal spaces. Dog parks, doggy daycare, training classes, boarding facilities, your veterinarian’s clinic, and even the sidewalk in front of your home are all frequented by other animals (pets and wild creatures) who leave traces of their visit behind that could contain dangerous viruses and bacteria. ",
        block2: "Human houseguests can bring something unexpected. Even if a pet is strictly indoors, owners, visitors, and dogwalkers/pet sitters can bring diseases into the home on their shoes and clothes without knowing it. This is why even indoor-only dogs are at risk if they’re not vaccinated.",
        block3: "We’re all living with fewer borders. With more than 2 million animals flying per year[1] and more than 65% of RVers bringing a pet on their excursions[2], local dogs are becoming international travelers. They’re being exposed to dangers and potentially bringing back viruses that may not exist in their home turf. Additionally, 20% of pet owners admit to sneaking their pets into hotel rooms[2], so you may be exposed to things you can bring home to your dog while you’re enjoying a pup-free vacation.",

You’ll also want to prepare your dog for boarding to limit their stress (especially if you’re boarding them for the first time).Here are some dog boarding tips to help you find the right place and help your dog feel comfortable at their home away from home.",
        block2: "Consider whether your dog has the right temperament for staying at a boarding facility. If the dogs are in daycare during the day at the facility, your dog will need to have good social skills. If your dog doesn’t enjoy the company of other dogs, look for a boarding facility that keeps the dogs separate or hire a pet sitter who can stay in your home instead.",
        block3: "Each dog is unique, so matching a boarding facility’s amenities with your dog’s needs will help to set them up for a successful stay. Dogs with separation anxiety need extra preparation before being boarded. Spending time at the new facility to acclimate and get to know the staff can be very helpful. Choose a facility that allows trial visits and is willing to spend the extra time needed to help your dog feel more comfortable.",

It doesn’t matter if you’re human or feline — having eye issues is an uncomfortable and miserable feeling — but there’s plenty you and your veterinarian can do to treat conjunctivitis and have your cat feeling better in no time.",
        block1: " The inner surfaces of a cat’s eyelids are lined with a thin mucous membrane (conjunctiva). The conjunctiva also coats the outer surface of the eyeball. When it’s healthy, it’s slippery, smooth, and soft pink in color. The purpose of this membrane is to provide lubrication for the eyeball by functioning as a passageway for tears that make contact with the surface. The tears are distributed as the cat blinks. The conjunctiva also helps prevent eye infections by holding antibodies within its lining. When this tissue becomes inflamed, the technical term is conjunctivitis.",
        block2: "While cats of any age can be affected, conjunctivitis is most common in younger cats. This is especially the case for kittens less than a year old. There also seems to be a higher prevalence of conjunctivitis in purebred cats. Additionally, those breeds with flat faces and shortened noses, such as Persians and Himalayans, seem more susceptible to conjunctivitis. This condition is also relatively common in cats who are immunocompromised, including those with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) or feline leukemia virus (FeLV).",
